Smart cities use information and communication technologies to enhance the quality of urban services, reduce costs, and engage more effectively with citizens. The concept of a smart city involves the integration of IoT devices, sensors, and data analytics to monitor and manage various aspects of urban life. These technologies can be used to improve transportation systems, energy usage, public services, and overall quality of life. 

Key components of smart cities include:
1. Smart infrastructure that can monitor and manage resources efficiently
2. Connected transportation systems that reduce congestion and pollution
3. Digital government services that enhance citizen engagement
4. Sustainable energy solutions that reduce environmental impact

Smart cities represent a paradigm shift in urban planning, moving from reactive approaches to proactive, data-driven decision-making processes.
