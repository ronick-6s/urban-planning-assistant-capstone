Affordable housing refers to housing units that are affordable to households with incomes below the median household income. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines housing as affordable when occupants spend no more than 30% of their income on housing costs, including utilities.

Types of affordable housing:
1. Public housing - Government-owned rental housing for low-income residents
2. Subsidized housing - Private housing with government subsidies to reduce costs
3. Income-restricted housing - Housing with eligibility requirements based on income levels
4. Workforce housing - Housing affordable to moderate-income households (80-120% of area median income)
5. Naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) - Market-rate housing that is affordable without subsidies

Affordable housing policies and tools:
- Inclusionary zoning requirements
- Housing trust funds
- Tax incentives and credits for affordable housing development
- Rent control and stabilization measures
- Community land trusts
- Public-private partnerships
- Density bonuses for affordable units

Challenges in affordable housing:
- Gap between housing costs and incomes
- Limited funding for subsidies and development
- NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) opposition
- Regulatory barriers to development
- Land costs and availability
- Construction and development costs

Successful affordable housing initiatives often involve comprehensive approaches that address both supply and demand factors, leverage multiple funding sources, engage communities in planning processes, and integrate affordable housing with transportation, employment, and services. Examples include Vienna's social housing program, Singapore's public housing system, and inclusionary zoning policies in cities like San Francisco and Boston.
