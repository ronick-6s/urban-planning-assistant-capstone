Transit-oriented development (TOD) is an urban planning approach that creates compact, walkable, pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use communities centered around high-quality public transportation systems. TOD aims to maximize access to public transit and reduce automobile dependency by integrating land use and transportation planning.

Core principles of transit-oriented development include:

1. Mixed-use development within walking distance of transit stations (typically within a quarter to half-mile radius)
2. Higher density development closer to transit nodes
3. Pedestrian and bicycle-friendly street networks that prioritize non-motorized mobility
4. Reduced parking requirements compared to conventional development
5. Public spaces and amenities near transit stations to create community focal points

Benefits of transit-oriented development:
- Reduced vehicle miles traveled and associated greenhouse gas emissions
- Increased transit ridership and fare revenue
- Reduced household transportation costs
- Greater mobility options for non-drivers
- Improved public health through active transportation
- Enhanced economic development and property values around transit stations

Successful implementation of TOD requires:
- Supportive zoning and land use policies
- Public-private partnerships
- Strategic infrastructure investments
- Community engagement and participation
- Market-responsive development strategies

Notable examples of successful TOD include Arlington's Rosslyn-Ballston corridor in Virginia, Fruitvale Transit Village in Oakland, California, and Copenhagen's Finger Plan in Denmark. These examples demonstrate how coordinating transit and land use can create more sustainable, equitable, and livable urban environments.
