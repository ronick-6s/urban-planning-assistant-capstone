Climate resilient urban planning focuses on developing cities that can adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. This approach integrates climate science, risk assessment, and adaptive strategies into traditional urban planning processes to create more sustainable and resilient urban environments.

Key strategies for climate resilient urban planning:

1. Green infrastructure:
   - Urban forests and tree canopy enhancement
   - Green roofs and living walls
   - Bioswales and rain gardens
   - Permeable pavements

2. Water management:
   - Integrated watershed planning
   - Floodplain restoration and protection
   - Water-sensitive urban design
   - Decentralized stormwater systems
   - Drought-resistant landscaping

3. Energy systems:
   - Distributed renewable energy generation
   - District heating and cooling
   - Microgrids and energy storage
   - Passive building design

4. Transportation:
   - Transit-oriented development
   - Electric vehicle infrastructure
   - Complete streets and active transportation
   - Transportation demand management

5. Land use planning:
   - Compact, mixed-use development
   - Transit-oriented development
   - Urban growth boundaries
   - Climate-informed zoning and building codes

Benefits of climate resilient planning:
- Reduced vulnerability to climate hazards
- Lower infrastructure damage and recovery costs
- Enhanced ecosystem services
- Improved public health outcomes
- Energy and resource efficiency
- Economic opportunities in green sectors

Examples of climate resilient cities include Rotterdam's water management systems, Copenhagen's cycle infrastructure and carbon neutrality plan, and Singapore's integrated approach to urban cooling and water management. These cities demonstrate that proactive planning for climate change can create more livable, sustainable, and economically viable urban environments.
