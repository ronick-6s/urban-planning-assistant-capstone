Complete Streets is an urban planning and transportation policy approach that requires streets to be designed and operated to enable safe, convenient, and comfortable access and travel for users of all ages and abilities, regardless of their mode of transportation. Complete Streets prioritize safety, comfort, and accessibility over the traditional focus on vehicle throughput.

Key elements of Complete Streets:
1. Sidewalks with adequate width, buffer zones, and accessibility features
2. Bike lanes, cycle tracks, or shared-use paths for cyclists
3. Frequent and safe crossing opportunities for pedestrians
4. Median islands and curb extensions to reduce crossing distances
5. Bus lanes, transit signal priority, and accessible transit stops
6. Traffic calming measures to reduce vehicle speeds
7. Street trees, lighting, and amenities to enhance the public realm

Benefits of Complete Streets:
- Improved safety for all road users
- Enhanced mobility options and transportation equity
- Increased physical activity and public health
- Economic revitalization in commercial areas
- Reduced vehicle emissions and environmental impacts
- Improved quality of life and community cohesion

Implementing Complete Streets requires:
- Policy adoption at municipal or state levels
- Design standards and guidelines that accommodate all users
- Project prioritization that addresses equity concerns
- Performance measures that go beyond vehicle level of service
- Interdepartmental coordination and stakeholder engagement

Notable Complete Streets implementations include New York City's transformation of Broadway, Copenhagen's bicycle network, and Portland, Oregon's neighborhood greenways. These examples demonstrate that redesigning streets for all users can create safer, more equitable, and more livable urban environments.
