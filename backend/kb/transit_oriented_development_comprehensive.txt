# Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)

## Definition and Core Principles

Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is an urban planning and design strategy that focuses on creating compact, walkable, mixed-use communities centered around high-quality public transportation systems. The primary goal of TOD is to create vibrant, sustainable neighborhoods that reduce car dependency, promote active transportation, and enhance quality of life.

### Key Principles of Transit-Oriented Development:

1. **Density and Compact Development**
   - Higher-density residential and commercial development near transit stations
   - Efficient use of land within walking distance of transit
   - Gradual transition to lower densities further from transit nodes
   - Strategic infill development in established areas

2. **Mixed Land Uses**
   - Integration of residential, commercial, office, civic, and recreational spaces
   - Ground-floor retail and services with residential or office uses above
   - Complementary uses that generate activity throughout the day
   - Live-work opportunities reducing commuting needs

3. **Pedestrian-Oriented Design**
   - Human-scaled buildings and streetscapes
   - Active street frontages with minimal setbacks
   - Wide sidewalks, street trees, and pedestrian amenities
   - Traffic calming measures and reduced vehicle speeds
   - Universal design principles ensuring accessibility for all

4. **Transit Integration**
   - Direct, convenient access to transit stations or stops
   - Comfortable waiting areas with weather protection
   - Real-time transit information and wayfinding
   - Coordinated transit schedules and frequencies
   - Multi-modal connection points (bike share, ride-share, scooters)

5. **Reduced Parking Requirements**
   - Lower minimum parking requirements than conventional development
   - Shared parking arrangements between complementary uses
   - Parking located behind buildings or in structures rather than surface lots
   - Unbundled parking separated from housing costs
   - Prioritized spaces for car-sharing services

6. **Public Space Network**
   - Plazas and gathering spaces near transit stations
   - Parks and green spaces integrated into development
   - "Third places" for community interaction
   - Public art and cultural amenities
   - Multi-functional spaces that serve diverse community needs

## Benefits of Transit-Oriented Development

## TOD Typologies and Contexts

### Urban Center TOD
- High-rise, high-density development

- Limited parking, high land values
- Emphasis on public space quality
- Examples: Downtown Portland, Arlington's Rosslyn-Ballston Corridor

### Urban Neighborhood TOD
- Mid-rise mixed-use development
- Strong local-serving retail and services
- Grid street pattern with high connectivity
- Balance of housing and employment
- Examples: Oakland's Fruitvale Station, Denver's Highlands

### Suburban Center TOD
- Transformation of office parks or malls
- Creation of walkable street networks
- Structured parking replacing surface lots
- Mix of housing types including townhomes
- Examples: Bellevue WA, Tysons Corner VA

### Suburban Neighborhood TOD
