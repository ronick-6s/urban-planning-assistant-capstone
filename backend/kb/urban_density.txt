Urban density refers to the number of people, dwelling units, or businesses per unit of land area in an urban environment. It is a key concept in urban planning that influences the efficiency of infrastructure, transportation systems, and the overall character of cities.

Types of urban density:
1. Population density - The number of people per square mile or kilometer
2. Residential density - The number of dwelling units per acre or hectare
3. Employment density - The concentration of jobs in a given area
4. Floor area ratio (FAR) - The ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of the land parcel

Density patterns in cities:
- High-density urban cores with compact development patterns
- Medium-density urban neighborhoods with a mix of housing types
- Low-density suburban areas with predominantly single-family housing
- Transit-oriented development with higher densities around transportation nodes

Benefits of appropriate urban density:
- More efficient provision of infrastructure and services
- Enhanced economic productivity and innovation through agglomeration effects
- Reduced per capita energy consumption and carbon footprint
- Support for public transit, walking, and cycling
- Preservation of natural and agricultural lands outside urban areas

Challenges of urban density:
- Perceived crowding and reduced privacy
- Higher land costs and housing affordability challenges
- Potential for congestion if not properly managed
- Need for high-quality public spaces and urban design

Urban planners typically advocate for "smart growth" approaches that focus density in strategic locations while preserving neighborhood character and providing adequate green spaces and amenities. The optimal density for any area depends on local context, infrastructure capacity, cultural preferences, and community goals.
