Sustainable urban development focuses on creating cities that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This approach to urban planning emphasizes environmental protection, social equity, and economic viability.

Key principles of sustainable urban development include:
1. Compact, mixed-use development that reduces transportation needs
2. Green infrastructure that provides ecosystem services
3. Accessible public spaces that foster community interaction
4. Energy-efficient buildings that reduce resource consumption
5. Inclusive housing policies that ensure affordable options for all residents

Sustainable urban development requires holistic planning that considers the interconnections between natural systems, built environments, and social dynamics. It recognizes that cities are complex ecosystems where changes in one area can have far-reaching impacts in others.
