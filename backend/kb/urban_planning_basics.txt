Urban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns, and villages. It involves the arrangement and design of buildings, public spaces, transport systems, services, and amenities. Good urban design can help to create places that are functional, attractive, and sustainable.

Zoning regulations are a primary tool of urban planning. They divide a municipality into districts or zones in which certain land uses are permitted or prohibited. For example, a zone might be designated as residential, commercial, or industrial. Zoning can be used to promote orderly development, protect property values, and ensure that incompatible land uses are separated.
